A stopwatch timer created in 1 day using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Details

- Simple stopwatch app with not many features.
    - I may improve its UI and feature list as time progresses.
- Initial project was made in 1 day on 21 May 2021, but then abandoned.
    - Now uploaded to GitHub in an effort to publish most of my projects sitting in my computer.
- One of my first few projects experimenting with responsive mobile-first web design.
